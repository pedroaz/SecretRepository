Instructions

-Open the solution using Visual Studio, and open in the solution the folder
according with the role you're being tested for.
-The intemption it is to follow the steps described below, but feel free

the employee and returns if the day of payment of the current month of the employee is either
a day of week, or a weekend day.
-Transfer the logic of knowing if is a day of week or not to an Extension Method.
